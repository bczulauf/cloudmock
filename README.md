# cloudmock
The goal is to create a developer workflow using the apis provided by Azure:
[The Azure SDk] https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-node

Design thoughts:
1. I want to see all my resources and apps.
2. An app (formerly a resource group) should be helpful.
3. A helpful app is more than just a folder.
4. A helpful app makes it easier to create and connect resources.
5. A resource should be an extension.
6. When I open a resource I should be opening an extension.
7. Extensions should be branded.
